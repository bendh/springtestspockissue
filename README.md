# springtestspockissue

Reproducing Spring context not injected when using new @SpringbootTest 
annotation from Spring boot 1.4 in combination with Spock test.

Junit test added and there the injection works fine.

Update:

    thanks to the tip from Dan Sayer on the Spring boot I tried with
    Spock 1.1-groovy-2.4-rc-1 and now it works. :<)
